== Instructions

=== Define piles

Group your cards into piles based on your desired criteria.
The recommendation is to have at least 10 cards for good unpredictability and at most as many you can comfortably shuffle.
The grouping criteria should be based on game mechanical properties.
A good criteria could be color identity or archetype.
You may have as many piles as you wish.
